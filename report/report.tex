\section{AI Collaboration}

Reflect on your use of AI assistants:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Which AI tools did you use and for what purposes? Through what interfaces (e.g., chat, code completion, coding agents, $\ldots$)?
    \item What prompting strategies were effective? What kind of context or instructions helped?
    \item Where did the AI provide useful ideas vs.\ where did you need to correct or guide it?
    \item What did you learn about working with AI on technical problems?
\end{itemize}
