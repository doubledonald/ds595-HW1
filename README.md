## Overview

In this assignment, you'll work with AI coding assistants to create a new MCMC sampler and rigorously evaluate it against standard baselines (Random Walk MH and HMC) on two challenging benchmark distributions.

## Getting Started

### 1. Accept the assignment

Click the GitHub Classroom link shared by the instructor. This creates your own private copy of this repository.

### 2. Clone your repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bu-ds595/assignment01-YOUR_USERNAME.git
cd assignment01-YOUR_USERNAME
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Open the notebook

**VS Code:** Open the folder, then open `assignment-01-starter.ipynb`

**JupyterLab:** Run `jupyter lab` and open the notebook

**Google Colab:** Upload the notebook and run:
```python
!pip install jax jaxlib blackjax arviz
```

## Deliverables

1. **Code/Notebook** — Your sampler implementation with experiments and visualizations
2. **Written Report** — Maximum 3 pages in NeurIPS format (use `report/report.tex`)

## Submitting

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete assignment 1"
git push
```

You can push multiple times. Only the final version at the deadline will be graded.
